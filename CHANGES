    Add back file-based tests for a variety of version 
    strings.

    Replace join on '/' with File::Spec::Functions to allow
    use on systems with volumes -- anyone with VMS kindly 
    test this for me.

    Removed anything git-ish from the module & tests.

    There is simply no way to get a consistent shell interface to 
    git across different platforms; every fix for one breaks another.
    Going back to the original approach of supporting only the 
    perl-version dir's, which has reliably worked throughout.

    Initial kwikhak... ah... er... "relase", yes,
    that's the word release.
