-   v0.9.6 Sat Apr 21 16:49:03 CDT 2018

    


-   v0.9.5 Wed Apr 18 09:44:19 CDT 2018

    Pre-clean directory in 11-*.t in case of repeated runs 
    or failure of cleanup in 10-*.t.

    Replace File::Copy::Recursive (see rt.cpan.org #125104).

    Correct typo in test looking for git.tar.

-   v0.9.4 Fri Apr 13 11:58:35 CDT 2018

    Add explicit check for List::Util 1.50 in 00*t. 
    
    Main issue at this point are sites with out of date
    List::Util lacking pairs. 

-   v0.9.3  Wed Apr 11 13:42:20 CDT 2018

    Put the . back in .git.tar.

    Use %vd as version for all non-ref $^V.

-   v0.9.2 Mon Apr  9 10:29:40 CDT 2018

    Deal with non-ref $^V in 5.8 via sprintf '%vd'.
    Add boilerplate output at parse time to show what is being
    processed.

-   v0.9.1  

    Add boilerplate to dump $^V if version->parse failes
    to handle it. This affects 5.8 only at this point.

    Minor changes in progress messages.

    use version 0.9918, see if that is the problem with 
    5.8 code blowingn up.

    Push a bit more of the git validation into KwikHaks,
    clean up logging.


-   v0.9.0  Tue Apr  3 19:01:18 CDT 2018

    Deal with multi-threaded tests by extracting a new sandbox
    for each Git test. This avoids failures due to mutiple 
    git calls colliding in the sandbox. Avoid shipping the 
    .git directory in favor of the tarball.

    Add sub to kwikhaks for generating tempdir w/ CLEANUP 
    in sandbox for each test.

    Add "work_dir" dir parameter for destination of copy. This
    is mosty for testing in multi-threaded environments.

-   v0.8.6  whenever...

    Reduce test output.
    Add sort to keep test stable.

    Require v5.8

-   v0.8.5 Thu Mar 29 15:34:58 CDT 2018

    Require List::Util v1.50 to ensure working pair functions.

    Added logging for git tests.

    Push all output through T::KH::output to avoid 
    interfering with TAP.

    Bump module versions.

-   v0.8.4 Wed Mar 28 08:18:44 CDT 2018

    Add sanity checks to test for existing tags; avoids 
    21* 31* tests failing due to lack of tags.

    Use "uniq" from List::MoreUtils since too many sites
    have older List::Util.

-   v0.8.3 Sat Mar 24 10:54:36 CDT 2018

    Use short (single-char) args for git.
    Modify verbosity of some tests to see where they fail.

-   v0.8.2 Fri Mar 23 10:55:36 CDT 2018

    - explicit $_ in -d.
    - Push most of the setup validation into 00-*.t in 
      order to get output (Makefile.PL doesn't show up 
      in testers' output).

-   v0.8.1 Tue Mar 20 21:46:05 CDT 2018

    "git tag --list" fails on some systems.
    Replace "--list" with "-l" and see if that helps.

-   v0.7.0 Mon Mar 19 21:34:25 CDT 2018
    
    More test code pushed into KwikHaks.
    More boilerplate.

    Replaced execution of dynamic file generation with generated 
    MANIFEST that has all of the dynamic content in it. This 
    passes "make test" here on an extracted copy of the tarball.
    This leaves me with a 1000+ line MANIFEST but lacking output
    from the original Makfile.PL execution there is no way to 
    tell what is killing the make-*-dir execution on about half
    of the systems.

-   v0.6.1 Mon Mar 19 12:50:30 CDT 2018

    One-time-hak of selecting STDERR in order to see output in failing tests
    in CPAN testers.

    Replaced skips with BAIL_OUT in setup for tests; remaining skip is not
    finding git installed, which dodges running the git-based dynamic tests.

-   v0.6.0 Sun Mar 18 22:20:49 CDT 2018

    Add output to Makefile.PL, try to figure out why version directory
    is not being produced.

    Added boilerplate to t/bin/make-* without add'l output. Someday
    these might even work...

    Dir.pm uses search_bin then search_cwd to locate version & Git
    dir's. Order makes more sense since Makefile.PL will be usual spot
    for exection.

    Push a bit more code into Util for re-use, push searches into 
    range of $Bin .. cwd if bin is below cwd. Avoids searching up
    large paths that aren't going to have anything useful in most
    cases.

-   v0.5.8

    Replace /bin/env with /usr/bin/env as possibly the only thing with a 
    more-or-less stable path across systems... Thanks to Thomas Klausner
    for checking this across systems for me.

    Ditto replacing #!/bin/bash with #!/usr/bin/env bash

-   v0.5.7

    Looking at it... probably want to search $Bin for git artifiacts
    first before checkin cwd -- normal users will want to find items
    relative to location of Makefile.PL rather than t/foobar. In most
    cases only one will find something, makes more sense to search in
    the users' order rather than for testing.

    Remmove extraneous tag from MANIFEST

-   v0.5.6

    Add META_MERGE into Makefile.PL for git (thanks to Jim Keenan).

    Require Cwd 3.73, hopefully avoids issues with infinite loops.

    Add "VERBOSE_FROMPERLVER" to set $verbose in modules, print 
    progress messages for debugging during install.

    Remove leftover breakpoints.

    Up module versions to v0.1.1.

    Split re-used utils into M::FPV::Util.

-   v0.5.5 Thu Mar 15 20:05:10 CDT 2018

    Fix make-sandbox-dir.

    Fix MANIFEST

    Alwyas remove version, dynamic, sandbox/.git dir's in ./t 
    to force running the build code during module packaging.

    Snag path search using File::Spec from FindBin::libs, doesn't
    seem to be any other way to deal with Windows (or VMS).

    Re-factor tests into Test::KwikHak to avoid cut+paste errors.

    Add steparate step to re-extract tarball and use Makefile.PL +
    make all test install prior to upload to verify MANIFEST
    contents (not visible in package, other than that perhaps
    the manifest is more likely to represent the necessary files).

-   v0.5.3 Wed Mar 14 22:18:31 CDT 2018

    Unlink all version.* tmp files.

    Deal with MSW filesystem not using '/' for the root.

    Missing file in MANIFEST.

-   v0.5.2 Wed Mar 14 16:16:10 CDT 2018

    Fix no 5.0 test to account for '5' or '5.'.

    Add test 13-*.t to check full variety of versions with 'no 5',
    hence the improvements in the no-5.0 check.

    Fix MANIFEST.

    Add strict to tests, fix undef vars.

-   v0.5.1 Wed Mar 14 13:43:46 CDT 2018

    Handle edge case "no 5.0.0".

    Search up $Bin for version directory. Simplifies handing standard
    path with test sub-dirs. "version_dir" can be path to any existing
    directory or the path will be searched up $Bin to the root.

    Test cleanups.

    More example output in POD.

-   v0.5.0 Tue Mar 13 18:24:57 CDT 2018

    Working version_from handler.

    Kwikhaks to generate version directory for a variety of
    version formats (make-version-dir) and recover the sandbox
    (make-sandbox-dir).

    Generator for dynamic tests based on version dir's (make-tests).

    The t/bin/make-* files are called from Makefile.PL.

-   v0.4.4 Mon Mar 12 10:14:04 CDT 2018

    Fix botched path in usability for extracting the 
    sandbox .git.

-   v0.4.3 Sun Mar 11 14:08:02 CDT 2018

    Added tests, shell script to generate minimal
    sandbox test directory (extracted as necessary
    via 0-usable.t). this needs to be re-run if 
    there are changes to the ./version directory.

    Added shell snippets to acquire usable test list
    into MANIFEST. The trick here is grabbing all of
    ./t other than the stub .git directory and including
    the ./t/sandbox/.git.tar file.

-   v0.4.2 Thu Mar  8 15:53:35 CST 2018

    Modify git tests to be language-agnostic 
    (hack regex rather than try to set the LC to 
    C so that folks can read the test results).

-   v0.4.1 Thu Mar  8 15:00:08 CST 2018

    Cleaned up packaging in the git tests.
    
    Non-URL git tests should now be portable.

    Still figuring out reliable way to test the URL handling
    (e.g., without a network). Any fix I can think of won't
    be portable to Windows due to lack of filesystem sockets.

-   v0.4.0

    Allows defining arguments for tball & url, takes first one
    that works. 

    POD for PREOP in Makefile.PL for auto-generating repo tarball.

    Git still needs testing, especially on Windows.

    Interface shouldn't change much at this point, main issue will
    be making the url-clone approach work and validating all of
    the ways that tarballs can fail.

-   v0.3.1  

    Test cleanups (mainly botched check for existing git executable).

    Start adding extract git from tarball of .git or url.

-   v0.3.0 Wed Mar  7 21:52:37 CST 2018

    POD & tests for Git, enough hacks on the Git module
    that it works with the tests (Caveat Emptor).

    Fix bug of $ENV{ PERL_VERSION } not being parsed and
    numified.

    Minor clenaups.

    Make consistent use of extractor's "value" method
    rater than looking directly into the hash.

    Extract::value rejects false keys (used to be only
    undefined).

    Bump the module versions up a notch to 0.1.0 since
    the tests pass and it all seems to do something 
    at this point.

-   v0.2.0 Tue Mar  6 19:18:15 CST 2018

    POD

    Bump version.

-   v0.1.0 Tue Mar  6 12:38:07 CST 2018

    Passes all Dir tests on all platforms, bump up version.

    POD.

-   v0.0.7 Mon Mar  5 23:06:03 CST 2018

    Correct error in Makefile.PL.

    Added tests.

-   v0.0.6

    POD cleanups.

    Copy message "files" => "files/dirs" to avoid confusion with
    list of files displayed.

-   v0.0.5

    Remove FindBin::libs from Makefile.PL.

-   v0.0.4 Sat Mar  3 22:51:10 CST 2018

    Modify tests, separate require from calling import.

    Report version of module loaded via require to isolate
    which version is not parsable by 5.8.

-   v0.0.3 Fri Mar  2 14:19:47 CST 2018

    Makefile.PL, add missing dependencies.

-   v0.0.2 Thu Mar  1 13:45:34 CST 2018

    Add handling for Git, split low-level functions
    for acquiring data into Dir and Git classes. 

    Utility functions have a few changed names to make
    them consistent with switching between subdir and 
    git tags.

    Git is largely untested.

    Added tests & sanity checks.

-   v0.0.1  Sun Feb 18 14:19:59 CST 2018

    Initial kwikhak... ah... er... "relase", yes,
    that's the word: release.
