=head1 NAME

Module::FromPerlVer - install modules compatible with the running perl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Aside: unless anyone can find a glaring omission in 
    # the mechanism or utility sub selection this will
    # become version v1.0.

    # ./version directory has sub-dirs with basenames of 
    # parsable perl version strings.
    # 
    # when this module is used the highest numbered version
    # directory compatile with the running perl is copied 
    # into the execution directory of Makefile.PL.
    #
    # source_paths() is useful for describing what gets
    # copied, cleanup() is handy for iterating tests or
    # prior to making a bundle.

    # Makefile.PL

    use Module::FromPerlVer;

    # relative paths to files copied for this version of 
    # perl -- different versions of perl may have different
    # collections of files copied.

    my $copied_files    = Module::FromPerlVer->source_paths;

    # remove the files copied and any empty direcories they
    # were copied into (dir's with pre-copy files left in
    # them are untouched).

    my $removed_count   = Module::FromPerlVer->cleanup;

    # at this point lib, t, and friends are populated with 
    # modules compatible with the running perl. because 
    # the destination directory is $Bin this can include 
    # README, MANIFEST, or Changes files. note that 
    # overwriting  Makefile.PL will *not* work since it 
    # has already been compiled.

    # override the perl version:

    # this can be useful for regression testing earlier 
    # versions of modules against the running version 
    # (e.g., validating experimental features, benchmarking
    # older code against newer perl executables).
    #
    # arguments can be passed to use or set in the environment
    # with a variable of the option uppercased. For example:

    $ PERL_VERSION='5.024002' perl Makefile.PL;

    use Module::FromPerlVer qw( perl_version v5.24.1 );

    # use a file to determine the perl version.
    # this takes the use-ed version from the file
    # to set the expected perl version (e.g., to 
    # validate if other modules are suitable).

    use Module::FromPerlVer   qw( version_from ./lib/foobar.pm );

    VERSION_FROM='./lib/foobar.pm' use Module::FromPerlVer;

    # or a one-line datafile.
    # "use vX.Y.Z" will find up to that version, "no vX.Y.Z" will 
    # use up to that version minus '0.000001'.
    #
    # perl versions with use or no support any version
    # string avaiable (see "version" module).
    # 
    # say that v5.24.2 breaks your module:

    echo 'no v5.24.2' > ./perl-version;

    use Module::FromPerlVer   qw( version_from perl-version );

    # override the source directory:

    # maybe you don't like the name 'version', you
    # prefer "history" instead.

    use Module::FromPerlVer   qw( source_prefix history );

    # maybe you don't like storing your older versions in 
    # a directory, you prefer to use git with tags to snag
    # the working directory with a default tag prefix of 
    # "perl/":

    use Module::FromPerlVer qw( use_git 1 );

    # use ThingyDotNet/<perl version> as the git tag:

    use Module::FromPerlVer qw( source_prefix ThingyDotNet/ );

    # set up everything but skip making the copy.
    #
    # this reqires callig "get_files" to get the 
    # versioned files in their proper place.
    #
    # none of the utility subs take any arguments and
    # can all be called using module or object notation.

    use Module::FromPerlVer   qw( no_copy 1 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

Basic idea: Divide up the source space for a module distro
by supporting Perl version. At that point when you want to 
start using features in a new version of Perl just start a
new directory and work with it. When you release the module
distro the module's version compatible with the running 
perl will be selected at install time. No tests in the module
for $^V are necessary.

Using this module requires two things: The module and a source
for perl-version-speific files. With "use_dir" the files are
found in a specific local directory; with "use_git" the are
found via (guess... if you said "cvs checkout from ./attic"
you'd be wrong).

=head2 Version Directory

The default directory for module versions is "version". This 
has sub-directories that are parseable as Perl versions:

    ./version/5.005_003  
    ./version/5.006001
    ./version/5.16
    ./version/v5.24

in each case the basename of the directory is processed by
version::parse. The module will find the highest-numified
version directory that is greater-or-equal to the current
perl_version (via $^V or set in the module).

The filesystem under each version is whatever dir's and 
files are suitable for that version of perl. Common 
examples are README, MANIFEST, Changes, ./lib, ./t,
./bin. Any files not included in the version directory
will not be overwritten (e.g., README may be consistent
for all versions).

=head2 Git and a version tag

With git the current repository is scanned via "git tags"
with the source prefix. The versions need to look path-ish:

    perl/v5.6.1
    Perly/5.005003
    MyPerlStuff/v5.24

will all do nicely: they have a '/' with a "basename" of
a parsable perly version.

The trick is getting a working .git into the module
distribution. As always, there is more than one way.

The check for using git starts with locating an existing
./.git directory, checking the tarball parameter, then
using a URL. During development in a working git repository
there is no need for the tarball since ./.git will exist;
after that if the tarball parameter is provided it must
exist or the extractor will die at runtime unable to find
it; after that if the git_url is provided then an attempt
will be made to clone the repository and extract its .git
directory for the checkout.

Providing either the tarball or URL arguments without a
.git directory and existing tarball/working service will
result in the death of your install.

=over 4

=item Git extract via tarball

Probably the simplest fix is to tarball your .git directory
and add the tarball to your manifest:

=over 4

=item Makefile.PL

Add a PREOP to the WriteMakefile arguments:

    dist =>
    {
        PREOP =>
        q{ /bin/tar cfv local_repo.tar .git },
    },

Specify "git" and a tarball to your distro:

    use Module::FromPerlVer
    qw
    (
        use_git     1
        git_tarball local_repo.tar
    );
    
=item MANIFEST

Add a corresponding record to your MANIFEST:

    CHANGES
    README
    Makefile.PL
    lib/Foo/Bar.pm

  * local_repo.tar

=back

At that point "make dist" will generate an appriate tarball and
"perl Makefile.PL" will use it as necessary.

=item Git clone via URL

This is still in-work, there are enough issues to cloning a 
URL for general consumption (e.g., without a network) that it
may take a while to make this work reliably.

    use Module::FromPerlVer
    qw
    (
        use_git     1
        git_url     https://foo.bar.com/whatever.git
    );

will do a "git clone", look for the ./whatever directory
(i.e., sans ".git"), and go from there.

Please relize that using this approach leaves anyone without
a network connection unable to install the module.

=item Bundling a ./.git directory

This is the easiest to work with if you are developing the 
module in a git repository. The git version extractor will
find a ./.git directory when it starts up and keep going.

Catch here is that if you don't make the tarball or use a
URL, the module's distro will require the contents
of ./.git in the MANIFEST. This is quite doable via 

    find .git -type >> MANIFEST;

but can lead to a rather large-ish manifest.

Feel free to filter out any hook files, etc, that are
not related to your version tags. The only necessity 
is a working "git tag --list" and "git checkout $tag".

=back

=head2 Options

Using the module in setup code (e.g., Makefile.PL):

    use Module::FromPerlVer;
    use Module::FromPerlVer qw( use_dir 1 );

will look in the ./version directory, sort the subdir's 
in numerically decreasing order by version (see version)
and finds the highest version directory that is
less than or equal to the running perl's version. The 
contents of this directory are copied to the same directory
as the running code.

Versions derived from "use" will be less than equal to that
version, versions derived from "no" will be less than or 
equal to the version minus 0.000001.

=over 4

=item Supplying the Perl Version

It may be useful in testing to choose a specific subdirectory
(e.g., regression testing older code with newer perl executables,
or testing the module itself). 

Each of these will be passed to version::parse for final 
validation. If version cannot parse the value then the code
will die with a "Bogus perl_version:..." error showing the 
version string being parsed.

In order of priority the Perl version used to select the 
module's compatible directory are:

=item $ENV{ PERL_VERSION }

Any true value of  will be used. If this is supplied with
the "version_from" argument a warning will be issued and
the environment variable will be used. Note that "Cat"
"Dog" and "I don't know" are all true, but useless and 
will cause the code to croak.

One use of this is testing the current module with multple
versions of perl:

    #!/bin/bash

    for perl in /opt/perl5/5*/bin/perl
    do
        for i in version/*
        do
            # pick the appropriate module 
            # version from whatever is running.

            perl Makefile.PL    && 
            make all test       ;
        done
    done

or testing all the available module versions with a 
specific version of perl:
    
    #!/bin/bash

    perl='/opt/bin/perl-5.24.1';

    for i in ./version/*
    do
        COMPATIBLE_VERSION="$(basename $i)" \
        $perl Makefile.PL                   &&
        make all test                       ;
    done

=item use Module::FromPerlVer ( version_from => $path );

The path will be scanned for the first instance of:

    use <version string>;

    no  <version string>;

and the first one located will be processed. The file can be a module, 
executable, or flat file with one line in it. 

The difference is that the "no version" will subtract 0.000001 from
the numified version string before comparing for the maximum perl

The main use of this is validating multiple versions of perl 
with a specific release of the module.

=item Overriding "version".

If you hate the name "version", use "version_dir" to set it:

    use Module::FromPerlVer qw( version_dir history );

=item Choosing the destination for Dir copy.

The default destination for copies using Dir is '.', which makes
sense most of the time. Parallel testing breaks this approach. In
that case use "work_dir" to put the copies into a seprate location,
for example:

    my $work_tmp    
    = tempdir XXXX => qw( DIR sandbox CLEANP 1 );

    use Module::FromPerlVer ( work_dir => $work_tmp );

will make all of the copies from version into the temporary directory.

=item Skipping the Copy

If you prefer to call get_files yourself (e.g., after
cleanup or pre-configuring some other part of the 
environment) use:

    use Module::FromPerlVer qw( no_copy 1 );

This will install all of the utility subs (see "Utility Subs"
below) but will not execute get_files().

=back

=head2 Use Messages

The module supplies most of the information necessary to 
debug environment and configuration issues when import()
is called.

The leading '#' in messages simplify handling output with TAP.

For example, using a version directory gives:

    # Def: default_use = 'dir'
    # Def: version_dir = 'version'
    # Def: git_prefix = 'perl/'
    # Extract with: 'Dir' (Module::FromPerlVer::Dir)
    # Perl version: 5.026001
    # Source prefix: ./t/version
    # Module version: 5.005003 <= 5.026001
    # Module source: ./t/version/5.005003
    # Source files:
    #   ./lib/Foo.pm
    #   ./pod/Foo.pod
    #   ./etc/version.dat
    # Install cleanup.
    # Get files with: 'Dir'

Another example with a file_from input (t/bin/30*_t):

    # Testing perl version: '5.005003'.
    # Def: git_prefix = 'perl/'
    # Arg: use_dir = '1'
    # Def: git_repo_file = 'git-repository.tar'
    # Arg: version_from = 'perl_version.RE0R'
    # Def: default_use = 'dir'
    # Def: version_dir = 'version'
    # Extract with: 'Dir' (Module::FromPerlVer::Dir)
    # Perl version: 5.005003
    # Source prefix: ./t/version
    # Module version: 5.001000 <= 5.005003
    # Module source: ./t/version/v5.000001
    # Source files:
    #       ./lib/Foo.pm
    #       ./lib/Bar.pm
    #       ./pod/Foo.pod
    #       ./pod/Bar.pod
    #       ./etc/Foo.dat
    #       ./etc/Bar.dat
    # Install cleanup.
    # Get files with: 'Dir'
    # Processed: 10 files/dirs from './t/version/v5.000001'

The arguments parsed were "use_dir" and "version_from" using
1 and a tempfile. Notice it found the "verison" directory
in "./t/version" since the tests run from ./t and $Bin is 
searched up the path.

=over 4

=item Configuration

Prefixes are 'Def', 'Env', 'Arg' which show where the values came 
from.

For exmaple, these are default values:

    # Def: default_use = 'dir'
    # Def: version_dir = 'version'
    # Def: git_prefix = 'perl/'

=item Handler

This shows which of use_* or the default_use was
chosen for the copy handler. In this case the 
default_use value of 'dir' provided the source:

    # Extract with: 'Dir' (Module::FromPerlVer::Dir)

=item Utility Installation

When the utility subs are installed they provide 
basic information about the values selected from
the arguments, perl version, and workspace.

See "Utility Subs" (below) for more information on
their use.

=back

=head2 Utility Subs

A few utility sub's are installed into Module::FromPerlVer 
when it is used. These are used internally to drive the 
file copy process and can be used to supply the values used
to build the module filesytem.

None of these take any arguments: they cannot be used to 
re-set the values determined at import time.

None of them are exported, they can be called usig either 
package or object notation:

    Module::FromPerlVer::get_files; # package::subname

    Module::FromPerlVer->cleanup;   # class->method
    $madness->cleanup;              # useful for testing.

None of them exist until import() is called: requiring 
Module::FromPerlVer will not install any of them.

The only one that is likely useful outside of the module 
itself are copy_files() and cleanup() which can be called
from Perl code for repeated testing (e.g., bash that iterates
perl versions).

=over 4

=item Calling convention.

All of these ignore any arguments, they can be 
called as class methods or via fully-qualified 
paths with the identical effect:

    Module::FromPerlVer::foobar();
    Module::FromPerlVer->foobar();

=item perl_version()

Returns the parsed, numified Perl version value (see 
version module).

=item version_prefix()

Returns the version dir's relative path or git tag
prefix (e.g., "version", "perl/").

=item version_source()

The subdir or tag from which the files are sourced. This will 
be a relative path from $FindBin::Bin or a full git tag:

    ./version/5.006001
    ./version/v5.24.2

    perl/v5.24
    perl/5.8.8
    perl5.005_003

=item source_files()

For directory source only (i.e., where the files can be 
looked up easily beforehand):

Used in a scalar context this returns an arrayref of relative
paths to files copied from the source_dir into the working 
directory by copy_files().

Used in a list context it returns two arrayrefs: one of the 
files one of the directories. The former is used with unlink
in cleanup to remove only the files that were copied; the 
latter is used to rmdir empty directories.

=item get_files()

This executes the copy/checkout of source files.

Note: If import is called with "no_copy" and a true
value then this will have to be called, see examples
for calling convention, above.

=item cleanup()

For Dir this removes the files copied, empty dir's left behind. This 
approach allows for some files to be re-used across multiple releases 
without getting clobbered by cleanup.  Likely examples are common 
tests (i.e., t/*.t) or a MANIFEST for modules which have all of the 
same files in each version.

For Git this checks out whatever branch was in use when copy_files() 
was called. That's the best guess I have for what was in use at the
time a verion-specific tag was checked out.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item Q: Why tags, not branches?

A given brach may have un-tested updates on it. At that point it
is not safe to assume HEAD will always work; at *that* point there
isn't any good way to automatically checkout a given branch.

Tags are static, can be assigned by the developer for specific
commits, and can be re-assigned as necessary if code is updated.

This also saves a whole lot of separate branches for version-
specific generations of code. Just leave them in master -- or
wherever you work -- with the tags behind.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item Module::FromPerlVer::{Git,Dir}

These do the low-level work of dealing with directories or 
Git repositories. POD in them descibes the progress messages,
error, and exceptions.

=item version

This does the parsing of version numbers from code and 
dirs. The POD incudes examples of both parsing and sorting
Perl versions.

=item File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced

Describes how the files are copied by Dir.pm.

=item ExtUtils::MakeMaker

See the sections for "make tardist" and the tutorial.

Definition of "PREOP" which can be included with the
Makefile.PL to tarball .git into a stock path included
into your MANIFEST.
